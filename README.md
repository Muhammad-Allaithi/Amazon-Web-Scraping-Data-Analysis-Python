## Amazon Web Scraping Using Python

## Project Objective
This project involves building a fully functional Amazon web scraper using Python to collect data on product listings. The scraper captures details such as product names, prices, ratings, and reviews, enabling detailed analysis and insights into market trends, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences. The data extracted is cleaned, structured, and stored in a CSV file for easy access and further analysis. By automating data collection, this project demonstrates how to gather large-scale e-commerce data efficiently.
